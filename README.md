This package contains the rtsched package for drawing GANTT charts
(chronograms). The package can be useful for drawing real-time timing
diagrams in LaTeX, as often needs to be done for preparing articles,
lectures and presentation in the Real-Time Scheduling research
community. The package depends on keyval, multido and pstricks.

A more complete documentation, with a set of examples, is available in
file rtsched-doc.pdf.
